# Advanced CSS Challenge: Professional Portfolio

## Purpose
The purpose of this challenge was to build a professional portfolio from scratch using HTML and CSS. 

## Description
This professional portfolio was built in order to showcase my skills and background. Within the portfolio page you will find a resume, contact information, a short bio, and samples of my work. I have built a portfolio that has interactive elements (such as hover) and responsive elements through the use of flexboxes and mediaqueries.
